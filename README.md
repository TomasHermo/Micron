Micron is an innovative, block-based modular microscope that provides a unique and engaging experience for both children and adults. Designed to foster interest in science, Micr贸n is perfectly suited for educational workshops across the country.

One of Micron's key features is its ability to be completely assembled, promoting hands-on learning and encouraging users to actively engage with the microscope after building it. Additionally, its modular design minimizes packaging and significantly reduces equipment costs, making it affordable at under $100 USD, thereby democratizing access to science, especially for those without resources for expensive educational tools.Thanks to its modular construction, Micron allows for easy replacement of worn-out parts and the integration of more complex components or upgrades, such as motorization or fluorescence capabilities, simply by installing new modules.

The 3D-printed design of Micron ensures exceptional image quality, providing an enriching observation experience. A unique advantage of Micr贸n is its ease of use: it only requires a USB cable for power and connectivity to devices like smartphones, laptops, or tablets. The illumination is provided by a 5W LED, directly connected to a 1MB color camera mounted on a USB PCB. Both components are seamlessly integrated through the USB cable, enabling convenient image viewing and capture.

Micron's primary purpose is to bring science into classrooms and educational workshops across the country, especially for students who would otherwise lack access to such tools due to their high cost and limited availability in educational institutions. By promoting scientific education from an early age, Micr贸n becomes a valuable tool for inspiring and cultivating interest in science among young minds, paving the way for a promising future for them and society as a whole.Moreover, this versatile instrument is not limited to educational settings; it is perfectly suited for field research, even in remote areas without access to electricity. Unlike conventional commercial microscopes, Micron becomes indispensable in these situations, as it is easily portable and functionally professional without requiring external power sources, except for a smartphone or tablet.

With Micron, the exploration of the microscopic world becomes an exciting adventure for students of all ages, who can assemble their own microscope and empower themselves with the scientific knowledge gained through this enriching experience. Discover the fascinating universe hidden from plain sight with Micr贸n!
